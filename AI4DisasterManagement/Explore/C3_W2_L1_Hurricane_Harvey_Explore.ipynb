    "# Hurricane Harvey: Explore the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore the Hurricane Harvey image dataset. The dataset you will be looking at came from [Detecting Damaged Buildings on Post-Hurricane Satellite Imagery Based on Customized Convolutional Neural Networks](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/sdad-1e56) and was prepared by Quoc Dung Cao and Youngjun Choe on the 13th of December, 2018. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01688.pdf) describes the authors' work in more detail and more [information about the original satellite image data source can be found here](https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/geoeye-1/). Individual images were labeled by volunteers on the [crowdsourcing platform Tomnod, now Maxar Geohive](https://blog.maxar.com/leading-the-industry/2019/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-looking-back-on-nine-years-with-tomnod). This dataset contains aerial-view windows of the affected area classified as damaged or not, along with building coordinates. \n",

However, doing a before an after comparison is one approach to doing damage assessment and a number of teams around the world have built such systems. Through these labs, you'll have several opportunities to look at before and after images as a way of visualizing how damage appears in the images and it's worth also thinking about how you might design a different type of system to recognize damage given before and after pairs of images. In many cases, you may not have access to images taken before the disaster, but even if you do, you would need to potentially deal with issues of alignment on a pixel-by-pixel basis between images taken at different times, as well as color variations due to different lighting and so on."
