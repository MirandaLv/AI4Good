# AI4Good


### Project lifecycle
- Explore phase (problem definition and stakeholder engagement)
  * Engage stakeholder (better understand the problem and expectations of what AI can help), identify key stakeholders and communicate with them to understand the problem.
  * Define the problem statement (be specific and transparent): give an idea of what success might look like; No need to mention the specific technology aim to employ.
  * Determine whether AI could add values: Explore the technical will be used, and whether the AI solution can bring value, or traditional method will be enough. Do No Harm Principle.
- Design phase
  * Prototype the solution: Is simple model enough? As they are easier to interpret and understand; Whether AI will add value, cost, computation time, accuracy improvement?
  * Ensure data privacy
  * Design the user experience: Data imbalance or other concerns about the data; What kind of model to implement and how to measure accuracy? What are the metric to consider. How will the end-user being interact with the system, etc.

- Implement phase
  * Productionize AI models
  * Integrate the user experience 
  * Test with end users and collect feedback, etc.

- Evaluation phase
  * Measure impact of the project, what does success look like? As during the exploration phase, such topic should be discussed. 
  * Communicate the results 
  * Determine the next step
