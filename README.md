# AI4Good


### Project lifecycle
- Explore phase (problem definition and stakeholder engagement)
  * Engage stakeholder (better understand the problem and expectations of what AI can help), identify key stakeholders and communicate with them to understand the problem.
  * Define the problem statement (be specific and transparent): give an idea of what success might look like; No need to mention the specific technology aim to employ.
  * Determine whether AI could add values: Explore the technical will be used, and whether the AI solution can bring value, or traditional method will be enough. Do No Harm Principle.
- Design phase
  * Prototype the solution: Is simple model enough? As they are easier to interpret and understand; Whether AI will add value, cost, computation time, accuracy improvement?
  * Ensure data privacy
  * Design the user experience: Data imbalance or other concerns about the data; What kind of model to implement and how to measure accuracy? What are the metric to consider. How will the end-user being interact with the system, etc.

    * Before implementation, checkpoint
      * How will you address issues with imbalances, biases, privacy or other concerns with the data
      * What kind of model will implement and how to measure the model performance? In terms of improving model performance, collect more data related to different senariors to help the model be more generalizable.
      * How will the design address the problem you set out to work on?
      * How will the end user interact with your system (model?)

- Implement phase
  * Productionize AI models
  * Integrate the user experience 
  * Test with end users and collect feedback, etc.
    * Checkpoint
      * Is the model performance acceptable?
      * Are end users be able to successfully use/interact with the system?

- Evaluation phase
  * Measure impact of the project, what does success look like? As during the exploration phase, such topic should be discussed. 
  * Communicate the results 
  * Determine the next step
